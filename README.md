# Disaster_Tweets_Classification
Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they’re observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).
But, it’s not always clear whether a person’s words are actually announcing a disaster.
We have to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. We have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets. We will use NLP (nltk package) to classify the tweets.
